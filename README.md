People who say, <i>“If you're doing something that you don't want other people to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place”</i> are engaged in extreme self-deprecation. What they are really saying is, <i>"I have agreed to make myself such a harmless and unthreatening and uninteresting person that I actually don't fear having the government know what it is that I am doing"</i><br>
